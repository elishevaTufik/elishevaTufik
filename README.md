## 🏥 AI in Healthcare – Project at Sheba Medical Center

**Pacemaker Detection from ECG using Deep Learning**

During my time at the **Cardiology AI Lab at Sheba – Tel Hashomer Medical Center (2024–2025)**, I developed an end-to-end deep learning model in Python to **detect pacemakers from ECG signals**.

### I presented this project at the 72nd Annual Conference of the Israel Heart Society in May 2025.
